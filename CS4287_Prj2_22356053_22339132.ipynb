    "## 2: Why Reinforcement Learning is the machine learning paradigm of choice for this task\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning is the correct paradigm for this task because:<br>\n",
    "1) Sequential Desicion Making: \n",
    "    - Breakout is a game where the agent must make a series of decisions over time. Each action influences the next state of the game.\n",
    "    - Reinforcement Learning (RL) handles such sequential decision-making problems because it learns policies that maximise long-term rewards, not just immediate outcomes.\n",
    "2) Delayed Rewards:\n",
    "    - Big amounts of points are only earned when the ball breaks a brick, which happens several steps after the agent moves the paddle.\n",
    "    - RL is designed to learn from delayed rewards, unlike supervised learning.\n",
    "3) Interaction with Environment:\n",
    "    - RL allows the agent to learn from trial and error by interacting with the environment. \n",
    "    - This agent sees the consequences of its actions and adjusts its strategy to improve performance over time.\n",
    "    - Supervised learning would need datasets of ideal, optimal moves, which don't exist.\n",
    "4) No explicit supervision:\n",
    "    - There is no \"correct\" move dataset for every state in breakout.\n",
    "    - RL allows the agent to learn automatically by exploring actions and maximising rewards."

    "## Reward Shaping\n",
    "1) Base Reward:\n",
    "    - The agent receives the environment's default reward from Gym, which includes points for breaking a block.\n",
    "2) Modification based on game features:\n",
    "    - Multiply base reward: Rewards from breaking bricks are scaled (3x) to emphasie their importance.\n",
    "    - Life loss penalty: If the agent loses lives, a pentaly is given to discourage risky actions.\n",
    "    - Alignment Reward: The closer the paddle is to the ball's x-position, the higher the reward.\n",
    "    - Anti edge-hugging penalty: The agent is discouraged from staying near the edges of the screen.\n",
    "    - Anti-jitter smoothing: Small rewards and penalties to keep action consistency to reduce paddle jitter.\n",
    "3) Purpose:\n",
    "    - These modifications move the agent towards desirable behaviours beyond just breaking bricks.\n",
    "    - They speed up learning by providing more freqeunt and informative feedback."
